## About the app

Meal.Match is a full stack web application that matches users with recipes. Users complete a short quiz indicating the ingredients they would like to work with. Using GraphQL to query the Edamam Recipe Search API, Meal.Match offers them 5 recipe suggestions. Meal.Match filters the recipes from Edamam's API, and calculates a percent match. This percent match indicates the percentage of the recipe's ingredients that the user already has. For matches that aren't 100% matches, Meal.Match generates a shopping list for the missing ingredients, and offers the user the opportunity to text that list to their phone.
